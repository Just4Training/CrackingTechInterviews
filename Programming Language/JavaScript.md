# JavaScript

## How JavaScript works
You might hear the terms **interpreted** and **compiled** in the context of programming.
- In interpreted languages, the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned. You don't have to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs it. The code is received in its programmer-friendly text form and processed directly from that.

JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that. From a technical standpoint, most modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called **just-in-time compiling** to improve performance; the JavaScript source code gets compiled into a faster, binary format while the script is being used, so that it can be run as quickly as possible. However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted language, since the compilation is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.

## Data types

### Arrays
In JavaScript, arrays aren't **primitives** but are instead Array objects with the following core characteristics:
1. JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. (When those characteristics are undesirable, use typed arrays instead.)
2. JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes.
3. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

## Class
Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, a class can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration.

```Javascript
class Rectangle {
    constructor(height, width) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }
}
```

### Private properties
Private properties get created by using a hash **#** prefix and cannot be legally referenced outside of the class. The privacy encapsulation of these class properties is enforced by JavaScript itself. The only way to access a private property is via dot notation, and you can only do so within the class that defines the private property.
